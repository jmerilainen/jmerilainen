Hello, I'm Joonas ðŸ‘Š

I'm interested in component-driven UI development, back-end development and automating things.

Currently I'm working at Frantic, a digital consultancy company, as a Senior Developer and Team Tech Lead doing full-stack web development and helping developres to thrive.

Below you can see a few example projects. Cheers!
